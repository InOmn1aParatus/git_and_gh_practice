I am motivated to change my career for two main reasons. First, Personal Training was a good part time job while I was in college, but some experience in the industry has led me to conclude that it would be an ultimately unfulfilling career. The second reason is that with the pandemic affecting my current industry so heavily, I was forced to pursue technical training for a career with much more longterm security. Coding seems to keep my interest, and seems to be as fulfilling as it is challenging.
